# Markowitz Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization with Predictive Stock Selection Using Machine Learning
# there are two main issues of concern for practical application. The first is that the MV relies on the expected return and risk of asset inputs to produce optimal portfolios for each level of expected return and risk (Beheshti 2018). As a result, by selecting good assets to put into the optimization process, the MV model may achieve improved performance (Mitra Thakur et al. 2018). Another issue is that many high-risk assets often return a large number of small-scale weights in the optimal portfolio, which makes them difficult to implement, particularly for individual investors
